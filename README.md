ninja-books
===========

This program takes a non-physical shelf of awesome ninja books and sorts them by title or author.  Then it 
displays them in a GUI, rotated as if they were on the spines of actual awesome ninja books.

Written in Java, the classes are organized as logically as possible and to emulate real-world objects. While it 
seems to be overkill for accomplishing the objective, much thought was provided into making these easy to expand 
for future projects.

To execute these files, compile all classes and run Librarian. Librarians are boss.
